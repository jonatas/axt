# Axt
Axt is a tool I'm building to compare parser gem and `RubyVM::AST.parse` builtin function.

## Usage
```
git clone git@github.com:jonatas/axt.git
cd axt
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that 

$ echo 'puts "hello"' | bin/axt
```
(fcall puts
(array "hello"
 (str "hello")))
```

I'm almost building to compare with [parser](https://github.com/whitequark/parser) results and see if it can be a good use case for migrating the parser for [fast](https://github.com/jonatas/fast).
